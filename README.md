McHacks 2022 Adventures Abroad Website
Developers: @BruneBettler, @gabylebideau2, @Lucas44, @gseym
Demo website built January 21-23, 2022, for the 2022 iteration of McGill University's McHacks Hackathon. Used React.js and accompanying libraries such as react-simple-maps, react-tooltips, and react-router to enable various functionalities while navigating the webpage. Due to OS-related issues on both Gaby Le Bideau's and Gaby Seymour's computers, their files were combined on Lucas Nelson's computer for Github pushes. Therefore, a more detailed outline of contributions is made below to clarify this matter:

@gabylebideau2: set up routing from the interactive map to the related pages, routing to the Google Flights itinerary, and built the navbar
@gabylebideau2, @BruneBettler, and @gseym: Built the individual homepages, including static markup and styling
@gseym and @Lucas44: Built the interactive map and static markup on the home page
@Lucas44: Resolved React tooltip issues, built the home page React components and the About Page, and handled CSS styling across the website
All team members contributed actively to the brainstorming, design, and overall layout of the website

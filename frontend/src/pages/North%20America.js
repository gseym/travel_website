However, measures to combat the Covid-19 outbreak, including flight cancellations and tight limits on people's mobility, have wreaked havoc on the tourism business, and with it, vast areas of the country. Panama's population has not been infected, which is not the case. </font>

      <font color="#FFFFFF">COVID-19 was the final straw for a country that had been on the verge of bankruptcy for decades. Costa Rica's finance minister recently warned that loan repayment will consume half of the country's budget in 2021, leaving the country with scant resources to fund pandemic assistance.

President Carlos Alvarado Quesada was alerted, and he set out to address the fiscal imbalance before it worsened the impact of COVID-19 on poverty in Costa Rica. The administration quickly saw three options: promoting economic growth, raising taxes, or cutting spending. Costa Rica's administration followed the latter two options after nationwide lockdowns prohibited economic progress.

      <font color="#FFFFFF"> Since the pandemic began in 2020, COVID-19 has had a massive impact on poverty in Jamaica. Jamaica has always been a popular travel destination for those seeking sun, beaches, and culture. According to the World Bank, the country's annual tourism numbers increased to 4.2 million in 2019, more than doubling the previous two decades. However, after COVID-19 hit the world, Jamaica's tourism business has suffered as fewer people are able to visit the country.

Businesses such as restaurants and resorts have seen a major drop in revenue. As a result, 50,000 Jamaicans employed in the tourism industry lost their employment, demonstrating COVID-19's significant impact on poverty in the country. As a result, many people who have successfully overcome poverty will almost certainly face this reality again.
